Being a "countryboy" for as long as I have been, it was an extreme culture shock cause it was two punches at once; <strong>your in a city</strong> and <strong>everyone speaks a new language.</strong> I've had issues with language in the past, what with a minor speech impediment when I was young, that had me learning chess before English. </p>

            <p class="info-part1 info">I've been someone that has been interested in many things. I've gone from wanting to be a Foresnic Psychologist, to going into Healthcare as a Occupational/Physical Therapist, and then landed myself playing around with Computer Science. I'm geniunely interested in learning everyday, even if it is something I've never dealt with before. I was self-taught in programming for the past 2 years while also going to Alamance Community College and working at Spoonflower. I'm determined to make it, whatever that eventually means.</p>
            <div class="info-lower-section">
                <p class="info">Now that I have moved on from Spoonflower, I am now venturing into the American Underground Community with Momentum Learning's help. I'm very thankful for my possibilities and plan on making the most out of the next 3 months.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="info-part1 info">I've played puzzle games since I was a little boy. My brothers would comment on how I would get the controller while they were out somewhere and beat their games for them even before I could speak English. I've always had a knack for figuring things out and exploring different avenues of thought. Understanding subtle complexity is something I truly enjoy. Part of me wonders if that may make me into a UX developer one day. However, I also enjoy handling data and populating websites with verbose and exact pieces of information. When everything snaps together, there is no better feeling.</p>
            <div class="info-lower-section">
                <p class="info-part2 info">Something that was going to happen earlier in the year of 2019 was that I was going to be apart of a startup marketing tech company. The year before that I was seeing about becoming a game developer. My interests at first were very sprawled and somewhat misunderstood. However, this gave me an intense interest in the design and building process of sites, games, and companies. The only downside is that I didn't become an expert in all of those fields of study. I just gained small bits of perspective of how to think in certain situations.</p>
                <p class="info">I plan to, after the cohort is said and done, get a job I love showing up for that challenges me but has it's satisifying ends of the day. There will be challenges that take some time to overcome, but I want something fun. If there is one thing I have learned over the years, <strong> it is that the experiences that we have make the story.</strong></p>

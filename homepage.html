            <h2>Where am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm from Hillsborough. Born and Raised as other southerners may have said 10 years ago but my family is from Michigan so that is why the accent is non-existent. Only when talking to neighbors does it truly come out. Momentum Learning is my first jump in a while for a new beginning and so far it has been amazing. Tons of great people, not only in class but as well as in the area around.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm 2X year old (the mystery makes it fun) and graduated from Alamance Community College. After that I did a program through MITx on edX that went into Computation using Python. I am a family man mostly for the fact that they have given me a lot of support through my life, even though I have only recently appreciated it. Yay maturing! </p>

             <h2>Why am I?</h2> <!--This can be explaining the differences that have made more into the person that I am -->
            <p>LETS GET EXISTENTIAL! I think I exist for some reason I don't even realize, which is a really crazy concept to wrap your brain around. I'm just a dude trying to make this life work while we are traveling, what is it, X,000,000 miles per hour through the space that we see? How does that not break everyone's minds? Like I'm here typing on a machine that was developed by engineers from 30+ years ago and it has come so far that I can create, through text, something visual and semi-decent (haha, not even decent. Have you seen the state of this page?).</p>
